My PhD Thesis is titled 
**Reduced Density Matrix Inspired Approaches to
Electronic Structure Theory** is available at [figshare](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1494690) but you can have a glimpse below.

The work presented in the thesis was done in the [Section of Theoretical
Chemistry](http://www.chem.vu.nl/en/research/division-theoretical-chemistry/) at the [VU University](http://vu.nl/en/index.aspx) in Amsterdam and  [Center for Superfunctional
Materials](http://csm.postech.ac.kr/research/index.html) at [Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)](http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/) in Pohang, South Korea.

The thesis was supervised by Prof. E. J. Baerends and Dr O. V. Gritsenko.

Thesis covers:

- Reduced density matrices and their properties

- Introduction to the Density Matrix Functional Theory (DMFT) and a survey of exisiting approximations

- Basis set superposition effect and the counterpoise correction in intermolecular interactions

- The formulation of a density matrix functional for van der Waals interaction of like- and opposite-spin electrons in the helium dimer
