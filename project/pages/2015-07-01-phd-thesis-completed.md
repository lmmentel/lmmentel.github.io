My Ph.D. Thesis titled 

**Reduced Density Matrix Inspired Approaches to
Electrocnic Structure Theory** is available at [figshare](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1494690) but you can have a glimpse below.

The work presented in the thesis was done in the [Section of Theoretical
Chemistry](http://www.chem.vu.nl/en/research/division-theoretical-chemistry/) at the [VU University](http://vu.nl/en/index.aspx) in Amsterdam and  [Center for Superfunctional
Materials](http://csm.postech.ac.kr/research/index.html) at [Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)](http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/) in Pohang, South Korea.

The thesis was supervied by Prof. E. J. Baerends and Dr O. V. Gritsenko.
