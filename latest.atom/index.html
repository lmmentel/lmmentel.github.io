    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;../blog/zeolite-classification/index.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;
I was exploring the database of of zeolite frameworks
using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandas.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt; and my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/lukaszmentel/zefram&quot;&gt;zefram&lt;/a&gt; package that provided
easy access to the data on zeolite frameworks available from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iza-structure.org/databases/&quot;&gt;IZA
database&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://helios.princeton.edu/zeomics/&quot;&gt;ZEOMICS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the topic further I thought that a grouping of the frameworks into
one-dimensional (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=1) and multidimensional (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=2 or &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=3)
might be useful. Such a distinction is largely related to the applications
since multidimensional frameworks have unique topological features such as
channel intersections that allow different phenomena to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the frameworks with multidimensional channel structures there are ones
that have multiple channels of the same size, for example &lt;em&gt;AEI&lt;/em&gt; having 3
distinct channels each along [100], [110] and [001]. The complementary group
would be the frameworks that have at least two intersecting channels that are
of different size. The latter group is usually referred to as &lt;em&gt;multipore
zeolites&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important phenomenon contributing to the unique properties of multidimensional frameworks is the so called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021951780903280&quot;&gt;molecular traffic control&lt;/a&gt;
which occurs where there are at least two molecules of different size or shape
where one of them prefers to travel (diffuse) along one channel system and the other one
travels along a different channel system. This fact together with the knowledge of the relationship between
the molecule's size and it's preference to choose a channel of specific size can be
used to tune catalytic processes occurring over zeolites. A 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201406344/abstract&quot;&gt;recent review article&lt;/a&gt;
about multipore zeolites explores their catalytic applications and the
role of &lt;em&gt;molecular traffic control&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;Figures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below presents all the frameworks with the zero- and one-dimensional
ones not colored. The multidimensional frameworks can be either two- or three-dimensional
which is indicated by the color of the outer ring. The inside of each circle indicates
the composition of the channel structure in terms of the distinct channel sizes. If a framework
is three-dimensional but only has channels on one size, such as &lt;em&gt;AEI&lt;/em&gt; it will be filled with
a single color. If there are channels with more than 12 T atoms they are considered extra
large (&lt;em&gt;XL&lt;/em&gt;). Since extra large channels exhibit very poor selectivity no distinction is made
here between them and they are treated as a channel of single (but very large) size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/2d-and-3d-channels.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;text-muted&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;2D and 3D channels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally since I mentioned that multipore zeolites are often teated as a separate category
I decided to created a separate figure where only the multidimensional frameworks that have
at least two channels with different sizes are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/multipore-frameworks.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;text-muted&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Multipore frameworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the previous case uploaded a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmmentel/zeolite-classification/blob/master/multipore_zeolites.ipynb&quot;&gt;jupyter notebook&lt;/a&gt;
that I used the generate the plots to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/zeolite-classification&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;. There are also some additional plots at the bottom of the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeolites are fascinating materials with quite unique properties. They belong to what
is often referred to as microporous materials which means that they contain
pores that do not exceed 2 nm (20 &amp;#8491;). That is probably why they earned
the name of &lt;em&gt;molecular sieves&lt;/em&gt; since the pores match the sizes of small
molecules allowing for size based discrimination. Initially they were a
curiosity to mineralogists but since their discovery they opened a rich field
of scientific activities and fallen under investigation by chemists,
mathematicians, physicists, material scientists, biologists and probably some
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a structural point of view zeolites are built from tetrahedrons that have
oxygen atoms at vertices and an atom of valency 4 at their centers. Those
tetrahedrons connect with each other by sharing O atoms (vertices) and form
intricate networks with repeatable patterns resulting in a variety of periodic
crystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the number of possible ways that the network of interconnected tetrahedra
can be arranged in space the number of resulting structures in overwhelmingly large,
however not all of the possibilities will be energetically stable and even a
smaller fraction is feasible to synthesize or find in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an illustration have a look below at the two possible frameworks that are
labeled AFI and MTT. Both are composed of silicon (beige spheres) and oxygen atoms (red
spheres) with AFI having 12 Si and 12 O atoms forming channels and MTT 10 Si and O
atoms form the channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/afi.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;text-muted&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;AFI framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=492px src=&quot;../../static/img/mtt.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;text-muted&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;MTT framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of all the zeolite frameworks that are currently available is curated by the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iza-structure.org/&quot;&gt;International Zeolite Association (IZA)&lt;/a&gt; which also makes
a catalog with the basic properties of each framework accessible 
either as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://europe.iza-structure.org/IZA-SC/ftc_table.php&quot;&gt;Database of Zeolite Frameworks&lt;/a&gt;
or in a published form as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780444530646&quot;&gt;Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types&lt;/a&gt; available from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iza-structure.org/IZA-SC_Publications.htm&quot;&gt;IZA publications page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many parameters that can be used to characterize the frameworks and
the empty space that can be found inside. Usually the internal voids are
categorized as cages and channels with their sizes given as the number of
tetrahedrally coordinated atoms (T atoms) forming the ring or units of length
suitable for the atomic scale such as &amp;#8491;ngstrom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I would just like to mention two of characteristic variables namely the
channel size given as the number of T atoms and channel system dimensionality
since those two parameters to a large extent determine the applications
of a given framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channels present in a given framework are generally classified according to the size
of the largest channel into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;, if the largest channel is assembled with 8 T atoms (and the same number of oxygen atoms),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;medium&lt;/em&gt;, if the largest channel is assembled with 10 T atoms,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt;, if the largest channel is assembled with 12 T atoms,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;extra large&lt;/em&gt; if the number of T atoms is greater than 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channel system dimensionality on the other hand determines the number of
dimensions &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that a guest molecule can freely travel through 
the framework once it enters the pores. Frameworks that have only cages or
channels composed of 6 and less T atoms are considered inaccessible and therefore
their dimensionality is 0 (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0). Frameworks with channels composed of more
than 6 T atoms and running only in one direction have &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=1. In the case of frameworks
with multiple channels running in more than one direction the pore dimensionality
is dependent on how the channels are mutually connected. If a molecule can move
between two channel systems &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=2, and when it can move between three channel
systems &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the current count there are 229 unique topologies recognized by IZA.
The complete listing of the channel system details for each framework can be 
found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444530646503686&quot;&gt;Appendix E – Channel System Dimensions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780444530646&quot;&gt;Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;graphs&quot;&gt;Graphs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a convenient way for accessing the data on zeolite frameworks
through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/lukaszmentel/zefram&quot;&gt;zefram package&lt;/a&gt;
we can explore how certain features are distributed. To 
perform the basic data analysis and produce the nice visualizations below
I chose &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;Bokeh&lt;/a&gt; package since it's a very handy tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;channel-size-distribution&quot;&gt;Channel size distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start by looking at a histogram below showing the frequencies of the
largest channel size (given as the number of T atoms) with a subdivision
into different pore system dimensionalities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/zeolite_histogram.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can be immediately inferred from the graph is that frameworks with
even numbered rings dominate over the odd numbered ones. Within the even
numbered frameworks there are 74 frameworks with 8 membered ring (MR) channels,
66 with 12 MR and 45 with 10 MR. When it comes to the dimensionality the largest
group is composed of three-dimensional frameworks (94), then one-dimensional (63),
two-dimensional (51) and zero-dimensional (21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details about the distribution of different channel sizes for a given
pore system dimensionality are visualized in the four figures below. Channels
that belong to one of the categories described above as &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;medium&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; are color coded. Additionally if a given framework is composed solely
of even numbered rings it is labeled as AlPO since it would be hypothetically
possible to synthesize it as an aluminum phosphate (AlPO). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zero-dimensional-frameworks&quot;&gt;Zero-dimensional Frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;

    alt=&quot;Zero dimensional Zeolite Topologies&quot; &gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-dimensional-frameworks&quot;&gt;One-dimensional Frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; style=&quot;width:750px;margin: 0 auto;&quot;
    src=&quot;../../static/img/one_dimensional_frameworks.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;Unidirectional Zeolite Topologies&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;two-dimensional-frameworks&quot;&gt;Two-dimensional Frameworks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot;
    src=&quot;../../static/img/two_dimensional_frameworks.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;Bidirectional Zeolite Topologies&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;three-dimensional-frameworks&quot;&gt;Three-dimensional Frameworks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot;
    src=&quot;../../static/img/three_dimensional_frameworks.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;Tridirectional Zeolite Topologies&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested how to create similar plots to the ones above I uploaded a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmmentel/zeolite-classification/blob/master/zeolite_categories.ipynb&quot;&gt;jupyter notebook&lt;/a&gt;
that I used the generate the plots to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/zeolite-classification&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;. There are also additional plots showing some of the other
descriptors for the channels and cages size for a given pore system (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://helios.princeton.edu/zeomics/&quot;&gt;ZEOMICS&lt;/a&gt; database), such as
largest cavity diameter, pore limiting diameter and maximum diameter of a
sphere that can be included.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; programming language is becoming the language of choice for large number of scientists and
it doesn't take much effort to realize why this is happening. One of the most important reasons is
it's simplicity that does not compromise it's power. It has a relatively low entry point since simple
python expressions resemble statements in English but at the same time it's a mature language used
as an indispensable tool in many operating systems, it powers up web services, and is used in large
scale applications. Moreover it has a great documentation system, helpful community and a lot of
online resources that offer everything from short tutorials to university programming courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so popular among scientists between a broad range of domains that there is now a meeting
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://conference.scipy.org/&quot;&gt;SciPy conference&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to scientific applications of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;. It is a great initiative that encourages collaboration and blurs the lines between
different fields of scientific inquiry like: chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science and many more, which is
crucial for research innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popularity didn't go unnoticed by an even wider audience since one of the most influential
scientific journals (Nature) published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/programming-pick-
up-python-1.16833&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; that recommends picking up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; to work much more efficiently, improve
handling of big data sets and create beautiful visualizations. You could also communicate your
research results more efficiently through building websites or web applications (also with Python
tools). Collaboration and publishing also became more efficient with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt;
that were highlighted in another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.
If you are curious to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; working together for various applications
(including scientific ones) have a look at the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-and-IPython-Notebooks&quot;&gt;gallery of interesting Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already a lot of useful tools, packages and libraries written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; to help
you improve your research and most of them can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi&quot;&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. However finding relevant content might be a bit difficult due to to
the sheer number of packages on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi&quot;&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt; or repositories on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, therefore I decided to create a list of packages that are related to
chemistry (since I'm a chemist) inspired by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome&quot;&gt;awesome list repo&lt;/a&gt;.
You can find the list in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/awesome-python-chemistry&quot;&gt;repository on github&lt;/a&gt; and
below in this post. Additionally I included some of the more useful scientific packages from the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://awesome-python.com&quot;&gt;awesome-python&lt;/a&gt; list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite sure that the list below is not complete and there are a lot more useful packages
that should be included. If you would like to suggest a package that is not mentioned yet, please
write an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/awesome-python-chemistry/issues&quot;&gt;issue on github&lt;/a&gt; or submit a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/awesome-python-chemistry/pulls&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;. If both of the above
sound difficult you can always write a commend below or drop me an email.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="http://localhost/blog/mendeleev-web-app/" />
    <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-short&quot;&gt;In Short:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;mendeleev app&lt;/a&gt; is a web app that
allows interactive explorations of the periodic table and relationships
between various properties of the elements and generation of aesthetic
images and scatter plots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I first discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt; I instantly adopted it to my work flow.
Currently I use it mainly for visualizing intermediate results in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt; when doing data explorations or code
experiments. The interactive tools it offers are extremely helpful especially with
larger sets of data and ones containing outliers where visual inspection can
speed up the whole analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading various bits of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh documentation&lt;/a&gt; I discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt;
offers a lot more that just &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; support but actually provides excellent
tools for creating interactive visualizations for for the web including plots,
widgets etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time I was already working on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;mendeleev&lt;/a&gt; python package which collects
considerable amounts of data on elements from reliable source and wraps it in a
convenient &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; API. Therefore when I saw one of the examples from the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html&quot;&gt;bokeh gallery&lt;/a&gt; that used the library to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/periodic.html&quot;&gt;display the periodic table&lt;/a&gt;
I started thinking about a web app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;periodic-table&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/periodic&quot;&gt;Periodic Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;main page&lt;/a&gt; allows creating custom made
periodic tables with a variety of properties displayed next to the standard
symbol, name and atomic number. The &lt;strong&gt;Property&lt;/strong&gt; can be chosen from the drop down
list and will be displayed in the bottom part of each rectangle that
represents an element. Moreover some basic properties will be displayed by the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html#hovertool&quot;&gt;HoverTool&lt;/a&gt;
when you hover over the element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second list named &lt;strong&gt;Color by&lt;/strong&gt; contains a list of common categories that elements
can belong to, such as: block, period, series and so on. Selecting one of those
categories will apply the appropriate color mapping to the elements. In the example
below the elements have distinct colors for different series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/periodic/?prop=mass&amp;colorby=name_series&amp;palette=Viridis256&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=700px src=&quot;../../static/img/mendeleev_periodic_series.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last entry from the &lt;strong&gt;Color by&lt;/strong&gt; list is &lt;strong&gt;Property&lt;/strong&gt; which applies a color map
(based on the palette selected from the third list &lt;strong&gt;Palettes&lt;/strong&gt;) to the selected property
resulting in a heat map - type plot. The example below shows such a heat map applied
to the values of covalent radius (Pyykko) where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html&quot;&gt;Inferno&lt;/a&gt;
palette was selected. The largest values are the brightest - yellowish color for Cs and Fr and the smallest
values are the darkest - see H and He.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/?prop=covalent_radius_pyykko&amp;colorby=property&amp;palette=Inferno256&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=700px src=&quot;../../static/img/mendeleev_periodic_cov_rad_property.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to save a png file with a particular view of the periodic table
you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html#savetool&quot;&gt;bokeh save tool&lt;/a&gt;
in the upper right corner of the plot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;correlations&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations&quot;&gt;Correlations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another useful feature of the app can be found under the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations&quot;&gt;correlations&lt;/a&gt; tab, where you
can produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot&quot;&gt;scatter plots&lt;/a&gt; and
explore the relations between various properties of the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main motivation for this part of the app  came from the observation that
there are many variations of the periodic tables on the web, however most of
them are focused on exposing information about individual elements rather that
uncovering the interdependencies, regularities and laws relating different
elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To update the plot select what should be on the &lt;strong&gt;X Axis&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Y Axis&lt;/strong&gt;
from the lists and additionally choose what category should be used to color map
the points. Below is an example in which the covalent radius (by Pyykko) is
plotted against the atomic number with series as the categorical variable to
guide the colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations/?x=atomic_number&amp;y=covalent_radius_pyykko&amp;categ=name_series&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=700px src=&quot;../../static/img/mendeleev_corr_an_vs_cov_rad_series.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations/?x=atomic_number&amp;amp;y=covalent_radius_pyykko&amp;amp;categ=name_series&quot;&gt;actual application&lt;/a&gt;
you can interact with the plot even further by using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt; toolbar located
in the upper right corner. You can pan the plot, zoom on a particular area, resize the plot
and save a resulting png image. Moreover if you put your mouse cursor over any point
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html#hovertool&quot;&gt;HoverTool&lt;/a&gt;
will give you additional information about the element the point corresponds to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example below illustrates how ionization energy changes with covalent radius (by Pyykko)
categorized by the block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations/?x=covalent_radius_pyykko&amp;y=ionization_energy&amp;categ=block&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=700px src=&quot;../../static/img/mendeleev_corr_cov_rad_vs_ie_block.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get Involved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot;&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt; as the framework binding all the parts together and internally
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pandas.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt; as the source of the data structures. If you are interested where the raw data
comes from check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data.html&quot;&gt;data documentation of mendeleev&lt;/a&gt;
where you can find all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions about the app or you found a bug you can let me know
by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/mendeleevapp/issues&quot;&gt;github issue&lt;/a&gt;
or simply leave a comment below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to help by contributing some code or documentation, that's
great. I'm open to collaborations so do not hesitate to fork the project and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/mendeleevapp/pulls&quot;&gt;create a pull request&lt;/a&gt; with
your new feature or a bugfix.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

alt=&quot;Geilo Winter School 2017&quot; style=&quot;width:760px&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently (January 15-20 2017) I attended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/geilowinterschool/&quot;&gt;17th Geilo Winter School in eScience&lt;/a&gt; organized
by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sintef.no/&quot;&gt;SINTEF&lt;/a&gt; in the beautiful ski resort of Geilo; roughly midway between
Oslo and Bergen. The winter school has quite a long tradition and throughout the years
featured an impressive range of topics related to computer science, mathematical modelling,
visualization and more. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/geilowinterschool/previous-winter-schools/&quot;&gt;full list&lt;/a&gt; of previous schools detailing their topics for those interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's topic was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/geilowinterschool/2017-machine-learning/&quot;&gt;Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Analytics&lt;/a&gt; and once I heard about it I couldn't let such an opportunity
pass by. For a long time I've been fascinated by artificial intelligence concepts from a philosophical point
of view but more importantly I was curious about the practical methods and techniques that I could
integrate into my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/geilowinterschool/2017-machine-learning/#Program&quot;&gt;The program&lt;/a&gt;
covered a broad range of academically and industrially relevant endeavors related to 
machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, statistics, big data,
and image processing. One of the talks that I really enjoyed was given by Mark Tibbetts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sintef.no/contentassets/4817fcaabf034bcfacadd625ac89498c/tibbetts_geilotalk.pdf&quot;&gt;Industrial use-cases and work flows for ML&lt;/a&gt;
where he showed how machine learning is applied to solve large scale industrial problems
and gave us a glimpse on the difference between using ML in an academic vs industrial setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an organizational point of view a thing that deserves to be mentioned was
the schedule which was neatly arranged to integrate a couple of hours of free
time before lunch to either have fun on the slopes or explore the various spa
treatments at the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was truly one of the best schools I attended so far. I had a great time listening to
the lectures, learning, socializing, snowboarding and discussing about machine learning
with people from various backgrounds since as it turned out I was the only chemist around.&lt;/p&gt;
