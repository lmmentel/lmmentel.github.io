    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I was involved in a project where I was simulating a chemical
reaction network leading to the deactivation of a solid catalyst in a tubular
reactor. As a result of those simulations I obtained concentrations of several
species involved in the reactions that were defined for a specific point in
space (reactor coordinate) and time - usually referred to as time on stream
(TOS). Naturally this kind of data fit very well to be stored in a matrix
form, and since I wanted to &lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt; the data to understand it a bit better
I started exploring options for visualizing matrix datasets using one of the
most powerful python plotting libraries, namely &lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org/&quot;&gt;matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- The same colormap was chosen for all the visualizations for easier visual comparison
between the results. --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-data&quot;&gt;The data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into a detailed description of the particular model used to produce the
data deserves a separate post and therefore I'll just mention a few important
points here and probably write a full length post about it some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all the model used in the simulation was designed to closely
approximate the actual catalysts deactivation processes that are also studied
experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the simulations the tubular reactor is approximated by the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_flow_reactor_model&quot;&gt;plug flow reactor model&lt;/a&gt;
to which a mixture of reactant gases are fed at specified flow conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to solve the model equations the reactor was divided into 200
separate segments and the reactions were evolved for 438 discrete time steps
therefore the resulting concentrations profiles are given as arrays of the
shape 438 x 200. This means that for a given specie each row of the array
holds it's concentration profile along the reactor at a specific time.
Analogously each column of the array stores the evolution of the concentration
in a discrete reactor segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;heatmap&quot;&gt;Heatmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map&quot;&gt;heat map&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most
obvious way of graphically representing a 3D dataset on a flat 2D plot. Each
value of the matrix is mapped into (or encoded with) a color patch placed at
the coordinates specified by the row and column. The color is usually
determined from a specially designed palette called a &lt;em&gt;colormap&lt;/em&gt;. There are
many colormaps available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org/&quot;&gt;matplotlib&lt;/a&gt; and choosing the right depends on a
particular application and probably your sense of aesthetics. I highly
recommend reading
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/10/16/how-bad-is-your-colormap/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;
to learn more about avoiding common bad choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- The heatmap below is a representing the data deactivation data ranging --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/simulated_coke_profile.png&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular heatmap was generated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://seaborn.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;seaborn&lt;/a&gt; package that provides a lot of
convenient, high-level methods for visualizing data with &lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org/&quot;&gt;matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;. The
plot can be generated by a single line (line 9 in the code below) however to
have meaningful axis labels and tick values I tweaked some of the respective
settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/lmmentel/688d0c5d4101a2cfdb3bb3913c9aa674.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3d-plot&quot;&gt;3D Plot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the data we have is 3-dimensional in a sense that we can assign an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; axes it seems only natural to try and plot it in 3D (more
accurately a 2D projection of a 3D plot). Since we can safely assume that the
physical quantity being modeled on a discrete grid is in principle continuous
therefore the most suitable choice seems to be 3D surface plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/simulated_coke_profile_3d.png&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a surface plot requires a bit more data manipulation since the
&lt;code&gt;plot_surface&lt;/code&gt; method expects coordinate matrices and not coordinate
vectors. Fortunately &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numpy.org/&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/a&gt; provides a convenient
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.meshgrid.html&quot;&gt;meshgrid&lt;/a&gt;
method to do the work for us. As in the previous case rest of the code is mostly updating some
of the display settings of the axes and labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/lmmentel/5ef001dece7165f71d4b114fbe43c2a9.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;animation&quot;&gt;Animation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org/&quot;&gt;matplotlib&lt;/a&gt; also allows making
&lt;a href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org/examples/animation/&quot;&gt;animations&lt;/a&gt; and saving them as
gifs or one of the video formats. Here I'll animate the deactivation data
showing one row of the data matrix at a time, one after another. The plot area
below can be thought of as the tubular reactor with the inlet on the left hand
side and the outlet on the right hand side. With the flow of gas reactant
mixture and passage of time the catalyst will deactivate, which in this
particular case can be observed as the gradual change in color from yellowish
to black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/coke_animation_magma.gif&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison I also made the same animation but using the &lt;code&gt;Greys&lt;/code&gt; colormap
since it is more realistic compared to the actual deactivation. This is because
the fresh catalyst is a white powder and when it gets deactivated it turns
black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/coke_animation_greys.gif&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particular method used in this example is &lt;code&gt;FuncAnimation&lt;/code&gt; that requires
two additional functions to be defined, one that will be responsible for
updating the plot values (in our case called &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt;) and an initialization
function that sets the values for the first frame of the animation
(&lt;code&gt;init_coke&lt;/code&gt;). The plotting is done through the &lt;code&gt;pcolormesh&lt;/code&gt; function that
creates a pseudocolor plot of a 2D array and can be thought of as a low-level
function for creating heatmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/lmmentel/1154b9289eb4a06e4823ffb38f4f3a7a.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the three visualization methods above I think the most intuitive one is
the animation since it quickly conveys the message and it's mostly self
explanatory. This makes it a preferable choice for slide presentations, web pages
and other digital formats, however it would be a poor choice for any printable
media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to creating graphics for articles, books and anything else that
is expected to be printable I would recommend the heat map over the 3D surface
plot since I find it easier to see the overall trend of the data changes and
also to read the value for a specific coordinate pair. The surface plot looks
much cooler but it might harder to read the (&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;) values having only
one projection. Moreover deciding which projection to choose or in other words
how to position the axes with  respect to the viewer is another issue that has
to be decided based on some trials and the features of the dataset. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Zeolite Framework Classification II</title>
    <id>http://localhost/blog/zeolite-classification-ii/</id>
    <updated>2017-04-22T12:00:00Z</updated>
    <published>2017-04-22T12:00:00Z</published>
    <link href="http://localhost/blog/zeolite-classification-ii/" />
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://lukaszmentel.com/blog/zeolite-classification/index.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;
I was exploring the database of of zeolite frameworks
using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandas.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt; and my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/lukaszmentel/zefram&quot;&gt;zefram&lt;/a&gt; package that provided
easy access to the data on zeolite frameworks available from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iza-structure.org/databases/&quot;&gt;IZA
database&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://helios.princeton.edu/zeomics/&quot;&gt;ZEOMICS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the topic further I thought that a grouping of the frameworks into
one-dimensional (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=1) and multidimensional (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=2 or &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=3)
might be useful. Such a distinction is largely related to the applications
since multidimensional frameworks have unique topological features such as
channel intersections that allow different phenomena to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the frameworks with multidimensional channel structures there are ones
that have multiple channels of the same size, for example &lt;em&gt;AEI&lt;/em&gt; having 3
distinct channels each along [100], [110] and [001]. The complementary group
would be the frameworks that have at least two intersecting channels that are
of different size. The latter group is usually referred to as &lt;em&gt;multipore
zeolites&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important phenomenon contributing to the unique properties of multidimensional frameworks is the so called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021951780903280&quot;&gt;molecular traffic control&lt;/a&gt;
which occurs where there are at least two molecules of different size or shape
where one of them prefers to travel (diffuse) along one channel system and the other one
travels along a different channel system. This fact together with the knowledge of the relationship between
the molecule's size and it's preference to choose a channel of specific size can be
used to tune catalytic processes occurring over zeolites. A 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201406344/abstract&quot;&gt;recent review article&lt;/a&gt;
about multipore zeolites explores their catalytic applications and the
role of &lt;em&gt;molecular traffic control&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;figures&quot;&gt;Figures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below presents all the frameworks with the zero- and one-dimensional
ones not colored. The multidimensional frameworks can be either two- or three-dimensional
which is indicated by the color of the outer ring. The inside of each circle indicates
the composition of the channel structure in terms of the distinct channel sizes. If a framework
is three-dimensional but only has channels on one size, such as &lt;em&gt;AEI&lt;/em&gt; it will be filled with
a single color. If there are channels with more than 12 T atoms they are considered extra
large (&lt;em&gt;XL&lt;/em&gt;). Since extra large channels exhibit very poor selectivity no distinction is made
here between them and they are treated as a channel of single (but very large) size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/2d-and-3d-channels.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;text-muted&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;2D and 3D channels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally since I mentioned that multipore zeolites are often teated as a separate category
I decided to created a separate figure where only the multidimensional frameworks that have
at least two channels with different sizes are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/multipore-frameworks.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;text-muted&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Multipore frameworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For clarity and easier navigation I also created a graphic where only the
multipore frameworks are included with the same color coding as above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/multipore-frameworks-only.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;text-muted&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Multipore frameworks only&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the previous case uploaded a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmmentel/zeolite-classification/blob/master/multipore_zeolites.ipynb&quot;&gt;jupyter notebook&lt;/a&gt;
that I used the generate the plots to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/zeolite-classification&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;. There are also some additional plots at the bottom of the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeolites are fascinating materials with quite unique properties. They belong to what
is often referred to as microporous materials which means that they contain
pores that do not exceed 2 nm (20 &amp;#8491;). That is probably why they earned
the name of &lt;em&gt;molecular sieves&lt;/em&gt; since the pores match the sizes of small
molecules allowing for size based discrimination. Initially they were a
curiosity to mineralogists but since their discovery they opened a rich field
of scientific activities and fallen under investigation by chemists,
mathematicians, physicists, material scientists, biologists and probably some
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a structural point of view zeolites are built from tetrahedrons that have
oxygen atoms at vertices and an atom of valency 4 at their centers. Those
tetrahedrons connect with each other by sharing O atoms (vertices) and form
intricate networks with repeatable patterns resulting in a variety of periodic
crystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the number of possible ways that the network of interconnected tetrahedra
can be arranged in space the number of resulting structures in overwhelmingly large,
however not all of the possibilities will be energetically stable and even a
smaller fraction is feasible to synthesize or find in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an illustration have a look below at the two possible frameworks that are
labeled AFI and MTT. Both are composed of silicon (beige spheres) and oxygen atoms (red
spheres) with AFI having 12 Si and 12 O atoms forming channels and MTT 10 Si and O
atoms form the channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/afi.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;text-muted&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;AFI framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=492px src=&quot;../../static/img/mtt.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;text-muted&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;MTT framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of all the zeolite frameworks that are currently available is curated by the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iza-structure.org/&quot;&gt;International Zeolite Association (IZA)&lt;/a&gt; which also makes
a catalog with the basic properties of each framework accessible 
either as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://europe.iza-structure.org/IZA-SC/ftc_table.php&quot;&gt;Database of Zeolite Frameworks&lt;/a&gt;
or in a published form as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780444530646&quot;&gt;Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types&lt;/a&gt; available from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iza-structure.org/IZA-SC_Publications.htm&quot;&gt;IZA publications page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many parameters that can be used to characterize the frameworks and
the empty space that can be found inside. Usually the internal voids are
categorized as cages and channels with their sizes given as the number of
tetrahedrally coordinated atoms (T atoms) forming the ring or units of length
suitable for the atomic scale such as &amp;#8491;ngstrom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I would just like to mention two of characteristic variables namely the
channel size given as the number of T atoms and channel system dimensionality
since those two parameters to a large extent determine the applications
of a given framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channels present in a given framework are generally classified according to the size
of the largest channel into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;, if the largest channel is assembled with 8 T atoms (and the same number of oxygen atoms),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;medium&lt;/em&gt;, if the largest channel is assembled with 10 T atoms,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt;, if the largest channel is assembled with 12 T atoms,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;extra large&lt;/em&gt; if the number of T atoms is greater than 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channel system dimensionality on the other hand determines the number of
dimensions &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that a guest molecule can freely travel through 
the framework once it enters the pores. Frameworks that have only cages or
channels composed of 6 and less T atoms are considered inaccessible and therefore
their dimensionality is 0 (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0). Frameworks with channels composed of more
than 6 T atoms and running only in one direction have &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=1. In the case of frameworks
with multiple channels running in more than one direction the pore dimensionality
is dependent on how the channels are mutually connected. If a molecule can move
between two channel systems &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=2, and when it can move between three channel
systems &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the current count there are 229 unique topologies recognized by IZA.
The complete listing of the channel system details for each framework can be 
found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444530646503686&quot;&gt;Appendix E – Channel System Dimensions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780444530646&quot;&gt;Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;graphs&quot;&gt;Graphs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a convenient way for accessing the data on zeolite frameworks
through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/lukaszmentel/zefram&quot;&gt;zefram package&lt;/a&gt;
we can explore how certain features are distributed. To 
perform the basic data analysis and produce the nice visualizations below
I chose &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;Bokeh&lt;/a&gt; package since it's a very handy tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;channel-size-distribution&quot;&gt;Channel size distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us start by looking at a histogram below showing the frequencies of the
largest channel size (given as the number of T atoms) with a subdivision
into different pore system dimensionalities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=760px src=&quot;../../static/img/zeolite_histogram.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can be immediately inferred from the graph is that frameworks with
even numbered rings dominate over the odd numbered ones. Within the even
numbered frameworks there are 74 frameworks with 8 membered ring (MR) channels,
66 with 12 MR and 45 with 10 MR. When it comes to the dimensionality the largest
group is composed of three-dimensional frameworks (94), then one-dimensional (63),
two-dimensional (51) and zero-dimensional (21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details about the distribution of different channel sizes for a given
pore system dimensionality are visualized in the four figures below. Channels
that belong to one of the categories described above as &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;medium&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; are color coded. Additionally if a given framework is composed solely
of even numbered rings it is labeled as AlPO since it would be hypothetically
possible to synthesize it as an aluminum phosphate (AlPO). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zero-dimensional-frameworks&quot;&gt;Zero-dimensional Frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested how to create similar plots to the ones above I uploaded a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmmentel/zeolite-classification/blob/master/zeolite_categories.ipynb&quot;&gt;jupyter notebook&lt;/a&gt;
that I used the generate the plots to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/zeolite-classification&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;. There are also additional plots showing some of the other
descriptors for the channels and cages size for a given pore system (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://helios.princeton.edu/zeomics/&quot;&gt;ZEOMICS&lt;/a&gt; database), such as
largest cavity diameter, pore limiting diameter and maximum diameter of a
sphere that can be included.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; programming language is becoming the language of choice for large number of scientists and
it doesn't take much effort to realize why this is happening. One of the most important reasons is
it's simplicity that does not compromise it's power. It has a relatively low entry point since simple
python expressions resemble statements in English but at the same time it's a mature language used
as an indispensable tool in many operating systems, it powers up web services, and is used in large
scale applications. Moreover it has a great documentation system, helpful community and a lot of
online resources that offer everything from short tutorials to university programming courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so popular among scientists between a broad range of domains that there is now a meeting
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://conference.scipy.org/&quot;&gt;SciPy conference&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to scientific applications of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;. It is a great initiative that encourages collaboration and blurs the lines between
different fields of scientific inquiry like: chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science and many more, which is
crucial for research innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popularity didn't go unnoticed by an even wider audience since one of the most influential
scientific journals (Nature) published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/programming-pick-
up-python-1.16833&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; that recommends picking up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; to work much more efficiently, improve
handling of big data sets and create beautiful visualizations. You could also communicate your
research results more efficiently through building websites or web applications (also with Python
tools). Collaboration and publishing also became more efficient with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt;
that were highlighted in another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.
If you are curious to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; working together for various applications
(including scientific ones) have a look at the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-and-IPython-Notebooks&quot;&gt;gallery of interesting Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already a lot of useful tools, packages and libraries written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; to help
you improve your research and most of them can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi&quot;&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. However finding relevant content might be a bit difficult due to to
the sheer number of packages on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi&quot;&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt; or repositories on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, therefore I decided to create a list of packages that are related to
chemistry (since I'm a chemist) inspired by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome&quot;&gt;awesome list repo&lt;/a&gt;.
You can find the list in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/awesome-python-chemistry&quot;&gt;repository on github&lt;/a&gt; and
below in this post. Additionally I included some of the more useful scientific packages from the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://awesome-python.com&quot;&gt;awesome-python&lt;/a&gt; list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite sure that the list below is not complete and there are a lot more useful packages
that should be included. If you would like to suggest a package that is not mentioned yet, please
write an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/awesome-python-chemistry/issues&quot;&gt;issue on github&lt;/a&gt; or submit a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/awesome-python-chemistry/pulls&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;. If both of the above
sound difficult you can always write a commend below or drop me an email.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="http://localhost/blog/mendeleev-web-app/" />
    <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-short&quot;&gt;In Short:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;mendeleev app&lt;/a&gt; is a web app that
allows interactive explorations of the periodic table and relationships
between various properties of the elements and generation of aesthetic
images and scatter plots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I first discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt; I instantly adopted it to my work flow.
Currently I use it mainly for visualizing intermediate results in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt; when doing data explorations or code
experiments. The interactive tools it offers are extremely helpful especially with
larger sets of data and ones containing outliers where visual inspection can
speed up the whole analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading various bits of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh documentation&lt;/a&gt; I discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt;
offers a lot more that just &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; support but actually provides excellent
tools for creating interactive visualizations for for the web including plots,
widgets etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time I was already working on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;mendeleev&lt;/a&gt; python package which collects
considerable amounts of data on elements from reliable source and wraps it in a
convenient &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; API. Therefore when I saw one of the examples from the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html&quot;&gt;bokeh gallery&lt;/a&gt; that used the library to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/periodic.html&quot;&gt;display the periodic table&lt;/a&gt;
I started thinking about a web app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;periodic-table&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/periodic&quot;&gt;Periodic Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;main page&lt;/a&gt; allows creating custom made
periodic tables with a variety of properties displayed next to the standard
symbol, name and atomic number. The &lt;strong&gt;Property&lt;/strong&gt; can be chosen from the drop down
list and will be displayed in the bottom part of each rectangle that
represents an element. Moreover some basic properties will be displayed by the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html#hovertool&quot;&gt;HoverTool&lt;/a&gt;
when you hover over the element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second list named &lt;strong&gt;Color by&lt;/strong&gt; contains a list of common categories that elements
can belong to, such as: block, period, series and so on. Selecting one of those
categories will apply the appropriate color mapping to the elements. In the example
below the elements have distinct colors for different series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/periodic/?prop=mass&amp;colorby=name_series&amp;palette=Viridis256&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=700px src=&quot;../../static/img/mendeleev_periodic_series.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last entry from the &lt;strong&gt;Color by&lt;/strong&gt; list is &lt;strong&gt;Property&lt;/strong&gt; which applies a color map
(based on the palette selected from the third list &lt;strong&gt;Palettes&lt;/strong&gt;) to the selected property
resulting in a heat map - type plot. The example below shows such a heat map applied
to the values of covalent radius (Pyykko) where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html&quot;&gt;Inferno&lt;/a&gt;
palette was selected. The largest values are the brightest - yellowish color for Cs and Fr and the smallest
values are the darkest - see H and He.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/?prop=covalent_radius_pyykko&amp;colorby=property&amp;palette=Inferno256&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=700px src=&quot;../../static/img/mendeleev_periodic_cov_rad_property.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to save a png file with a particular view of the periodic table
you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html#savetool&quot;&gt;bokeh save tool&lt;/a&gt;
in the upper right corner of the plot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;correlations&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations&quot;&gt;Correlations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another useful feature of the app can be found under the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations&quot;&gt;correlations&lt;/a&gt; tab, where you
can produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot&quot;&gt;scatter plots&lt;/a&gt; and
explore the relations between various properties of the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main motivation for this part of the app  came from the observation that
there are many variations of the periodic tables on the web, however most of
them are focused on exposing information about individual elements rather that
uncovering the interdependencies, regularities and laws relating different
elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To update the plot select what should be on the &lt;strong&gt;X Axis&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Y Axis&lt;/strong&gt;
from the lists and additionally choose what category should be used to color map
the points. Below is an example in which the covalent radius (by Pyykko) is
plotted against the atomic number with series as the categorical variable to
guide the colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations/?x=atomic_number&amp;y=covalent_radius_pyykko&amp;categ=name_series&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=700px src=&quot;../../static/img/mendeleev_corr_an_vs_cov_rad_series.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations/?x=atomic_number&amp;amp;y=covalent_radius_pyykko&amp;amp;categ=name_series&quot;&gt;actual application&lt;/a&gt;
you can interact with the plot even further by using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;bokeh&lt;/a&gt; toolbar located
in the upper right corner. You can pan the plot, zoom on a particular area, resize the plot
and save a resulting png image. Moreover if you put your mouse cursor over any point
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html#hovertool&quot;&gt;HoverTool&lt;/a&gt;
will give you additional information about the element the point corresponds to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example below illustrates how ionization energy changes with covalent radius (by Pyykko)
categorized by the block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendeleev.herokuapp.com/correlations/?x=covalent_radius_pyykko&amp;y=ionization_energy&amp;categ=block&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; width=700px src=&quot;../../static/img/mendeleev_corr_cov_rad_vs_ie_block.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot;&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt; as the framework binding all the parts together and internally
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pandas.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt; as the source of the data structures. If you are interested where the raw data
comes from check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data.html&quot;&gt;data documentation of mendeleev&lt;/a&gt;
where you can find all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions about the app or you found a bug you can let me know
by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/mendeleevapp/issues&quot;&gt;github issue&lt;/a&gt;
or simply leave a comment below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to help by contributing some code or documentation, that's
great. I'm open to collaborations so do not hesitate to fork the project and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmmentel/mendeleevapp/pulls&quot;&gt;create a pull request&lt;/a&gt; with
your new feature or a bugfix.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
